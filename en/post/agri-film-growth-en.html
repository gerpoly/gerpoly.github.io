But, as delegates heard, China has become a major user of agricultural film in recent years.<br>&emsp; &emsp;In a presentation at the conference, which was organized by Applied Market Information, ExxonMobil Chemical presented details of a five-layer winter greenhouse film concept that would give a longer anti-drip performance - something required by the Chinese market that cannot currently be achieved with conventional three-layer film.<br>&emsp; &emsp;”Tailoring the vinyl alcohol (VA) content in different functional layers is proven to increase the functionality/‘ said Zhen Yu Zhu, film application senior engineer at ExxonMobil Pacific Research &amp; Development in China.<br>&emsp; &emsp;The five-layer film uses 0.927d Enable metallocene polyethylene (PE) resin in the sub-skin, which helps improve creep resistance and controls the migration direction of functional additives. The film was 120 microns thick.<br>&emsp; &emsp;The film underwent a field dadding test in several Locations. One test showed that, after 16 months and two winter seasons, the formulation still retained its anti-drip performance. A conventional three-layer EVC film would last only up to six months, he said.</p><p>###　Chinese boom</p><p>&emsp; &emsp;The company - backed by industry figures - estimated the Chinese agricultural film market at around 3.3m tones in 2014, with greenhouse film (1.4m tones) and mulch film (1.2m tones) the dominant products.<br>&emsp; &emsp;C4-LLDPE represents around 73% of the market. The highest growth was seen for polyolefin coated greenhouse film - though that came from a very Low base.<br>&emsp; &emsp;Zhongqin Ni, chairman of Beijing Huadun Xuehua Plastics, had a similar estimate of the market - putting China’s annual consumption of agricultural film at nearly 2.5m tones, and greenhouse film at 1.1m tones. This can range from standard PE film to sophisticated functional film incorporating EVA, or special film for crops such as strawberries or grapes.<br>&emsp; &emsp;There have also been efforts to develop light diffusion films, which can prevent burning from direct sunlight, delay temperature rising speed, and achieve higher yields for stem-leaf vegetables.<br>&emsp; &emsp;“Since the Light and heat for cultivation in China are solely from solar radiation, the functional films that have higher light transmission rate — and enable faster temperature rising - are preferred,” he said “The development of light diffusion films, in comparison, is Lagging behind.”<br>&emsp; &emsp;The next milestone, he said, was to manage mulch film residue - first, by promoting the use of tough, anti-ageing film, and enforcing its recycling；and second, by developing and promoting degradable mulch film.<br>&emsp; &emsp;The cost of degradable film should be no more than twice that of conventional film, he added.<br>&emsp; &emsp;”We are willing to collaborate globally, to boost the development of China’s agricultural film,” said Ni, who is also vice chairman of the Chinese Institute of Agricultural Plastics Application Technology.</p><h3 id="German-collection"><a href="#German-collection" class="headerlink" title="German collection"></a>German collection</h3><p>&emsp; &emsp;Recycling of agricultural film has moved right up the agenda. In Germany, for instance, there is a scheme called Erde that collects and recycles many types of agricultural film. Erde is an initiative of the IK packaging association, and is operated by RIGK.<br>&emsp; &emsp;The voluntary agreement aims to circumvent possible European or national legislation on agricultural film by achieving a high recycling rate that operates across the country.<br>&emsp; &emsp;Collection began in April 2014, and up to October of that year it collected 2170 tones of plastics - 608 tones was stretch film, while the other 1,585 was silage film. During this period, there were only 130 collection points.<br>&emsp; &emsp;By August 2015, this had grown to 220 collection points in Germany. Erde plans to make one or two collections per year from these points, as well as collecting from Larger farms. Its target for 2015 was to collect up to 5,000 tones of material. Recycling rates are at about 90%.<br>&emsp; &emsp;Erde currently collects two fractions： the first is silo sheets, underlayer film and LDPE silage tubes; the second is silage stretch film and LLDPE net substitution films. In future, it plans to collect other agricultural films - such as those used in the production of vegetables -as well as yarns and nets.<br>&emsp; &emsp;Erde’s members are ManuU Stretch, PolifiLm Extrusion, RKW Agri and TriopLast.</p></div></div></article></div></section></div><div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><aside class="sidebar"><div class="widget recent-posts wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0ms" data-wow-duration="1500ms"><div class="sidebar-title"><h3>Recent Posts</h3></div><article class="post"><figure class="post-thumb"><img src="/images/resource/740x400b.jpg" alt=""></figure><h4><a href="/en/post/agri-film-growth-en.html">Looking for Growth, Agricultural Film</a></h4><div class="post-info"><span class="icon"></span> 2017-10-28</div></article><article class="post"><figure class="post-thumb"><img src="/images/resource/740x400a.jpg" alt=""></figure><h4><a href="/en/post/agri-film-future-en.html">Agricultural Film, Looking towards a Green Future</a></h4><div class="post-info"><span class="icon"></span> 2017-10-28</div></article><article class="post"><figure class="post-thumb"><img src="/images/resource/740x400c.jpg" alt=""></figure><h4><a href="/en/post/film-extrusion-tech-en.html">Raising Standards, Advances in Film Extrusion Technology</a></h4><div class="post-info"><span class="icon"></span> 2017-10-28</div></article></div><div class="widget popular-tags"><div class="sidebar-title"><h3>Tags</h3></div> <a href="/en/tags/Agricultural-Film/" style="font-size:20px">Agricultural Film</a> <a href="/en/tags/Film-Extrusion/" style="font-size:10px">Film Extrusion</a></div></aside></div></div></div></div><footer class="main-footer"><div class="footer-upper"><div class="auto-container"><div class="row clearfix"><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div class="row clearfix"><div class="col-lg-7 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 column"><h2>Contact</h2><div class="footer-widget about-widget"><ul class="contact-info"><li><span class="icon fa fa-map-marker"></span> Lindenstr. 48-52<br> 40233 Dusseldorf, Germany</li><li><span class="icon fa fa-phone"></span> +86-18526609508</li><li><span class="icon fa fa-envelope-o"></span> trade@gerpoly.com</li></ul></div></div><div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 column"><h2>About</h2><div class="footer-widget links-widget"><p>Gerpoly Plastic GmbH is a German company, which is specialized in producing and selling high-grade agricultural film.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div class="row clearfix"><div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 column"><div class="footer-widget links-widget"><h2>Products</h2><ul><li><a href="/en/products/hepp.html">HEPP PO Film</a></li><li><a href="/en/products/hepp6mss.html">HEPP-6 Light-Diffusion</a></li><li><a href="/en/products/msspo.html">Light-Diffusion PO Film</a></li><li><a href="/en/products/hbm.html">Black&White Film</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="col-lg-7 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 column"><div class="footer-widget news-widget"><h2>Recent Posts</h2><div class="news-post"><div class="icon"></div><div class="news-content"><figure class="image-thumb"><img src="/images/resource/740x400b.jpg" alt=""></figure><a href="/en/post/agri-film-growth-en.html">Looking for Growth, Agricultural Film</a></div></div><div class="news-post"><div class="icon"></div><div class="news-content"><figure class="image-thumb"><img src="/images/resource/740x400a.jpg" alt=""></figure><a href="/en/post/agri-film-future-en.html">Agricultural Film, Looking towards a Green Future</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-bottom"><div class="auto-container clearfix"><div class="copyright text-center">&copy; Gerpoly Plastic GmbH. rights reserved</div></div></div></footer></div><div class="scroll-to-top scroll-to-target" data-target=".main-header"><span class="fa fa-long-arrow-up"></span></div><script src="/js/jquery.js"></script><script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.fancybox.pack.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.fancybox-media.js"></script><script src="/js/owl.js"></script><script src="/js/wow.js"></script><script src="/js/script.js"></script></body></html>
